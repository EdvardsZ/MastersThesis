\noindent
This thesis presents two methods for combining the semi-conditional variational autoencoders (SCVAEs) with standard variational autoencoders (VAEs) which could presumably improve the performance of the VAEs. The first method is based on the idea of extending the VAEs with a second conditioned decoder. The notion of the second method is to use the same encoder for both tasks by employing smart training strategies. Both methods are applied to Gaussian VAEs and VQ-VAEs.
The methods are evaluated on various image datasets, and the results show that in some cases, the proposed methods outperform the standard VAEs.
