\chapter{Background}
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), first introduced in 2013 by Kingma and Welling\cite{kingma2022autoencoding}, have become a prominent class of generative models in the field of machine learning.  At their core, VAEs consist of an encoder network that maps data points into a latent space and a decoder network that generates data from latent representations
