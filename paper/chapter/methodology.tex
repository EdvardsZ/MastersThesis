\chapter{Methods}

In this chapter, I will describe the methods used in this thesis. In the first section, I will describe the SCVAE1D and SCVQVAE1D model architectures and the training process. In the second section, I will describe the SCVAE2D and SCVQVAE2D model architectures and the training process. In the third section, I will describe the evaluation metrics used to evaluate the models. In the fourth section, I will describe the datasets used in the experiments. Finally, I will provide a brief overview of the implementation details.
