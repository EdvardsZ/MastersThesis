# MastersThesis

1. Try multiple tasks, for both vqvae and vae -------- PRIORITY

2. Try Random conditioning -------- PRIORITY

3. Try Special random conditioning ------- PRIORITY

4. Maybe cifar, CelebA dataset -----PRIORITY

5. Reduce code dublication (Make one runner for all), Try use only one implementation of encoders/decoders.
Check if to train PixelCNN. 

6. Make a visualization for VQVAE

7. Make sure all params are actually passed from config not hard coded

8. Load the lowest loss model

9. Different hyperparameters.

10. Dataset variance detection and use implementation
