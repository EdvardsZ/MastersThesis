1. Decide on 3 datasets. - MNIST, CIFAR10, ??? CelebA ???

2. Make generated images plot if the latent dimension is higher than 2

3. Make one runner for all,
Check if to train PixelCNN. 

4. Load the lowest loss model automatically

5. ADAPTIVE LOSS

6. Pixel count distribution

7. Gaussian pixel sampling.

8. Nested Cross validation

---------------------
Optional TODOS:
1. Make validation for loading the configuration from file. Make sure to have correct types
