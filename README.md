2. Try multiple tasks, for both vqvae and vae -------- PRIORITY

3. Try Random conditioning -------- PRIORITY

4. Try Special random conditioning ------- PRIORITY

4. Maybe cifar, CelebA dataset -----PRIORITY

6. Reduce code dublication (Make one runner for all), Try use only one implementation of encoders/decoders.

7. Make a visualization for VQVAE

9. Make sure all params are actually passed from config not hard coded

10. Load the lowest loss model

11. Different hyperparameters.

12. Dataset variance implementation
