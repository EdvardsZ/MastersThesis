# MastersThesis

1. Try multiple tasks, for both vqvae and vae -------- PRIORITY

2. Try Random conditioning -------- PRIORITY

3. Try Special random conditioning ------- PRIORITY

4. Maybe cifar, CelebA dataset -----PRIORITY

5. Reduce code dublication (Make one runner for all),
Check if to train PixelCNN. 

6. Make a visualization for VQVAE

8. Load the lowest loss model

9. Different hyperparameters.

10. Dataset variance detection and use implementation

11. Beta for vq logging


----------------
Optional TODOS:
1. Make validation for loading the configuration from file. Make sure to have correct types
